My plan is to create a fully featured task management application. I won't be able to do it alone though. Your help is welcome!

This application is built with Node.js, React.js, Tailwind CSS and Kretes. 

## Installation 

Install dependencies

```
kretes install
```

Start the application:

```
kretes start
```
